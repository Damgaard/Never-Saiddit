the real world, it means things in the digital world as well. Never Saiddit
gives you the ultimate option, to delete your content on Reddit. It's simple
and protects your privacy.</p>

<p class="text-faded">Ultimately, it doesn't matter why you want to remove your
content from Reddit. It's your content and you should have the right to choose
what happens to it. If you want it to stay, it should stay. If you want it gone,
it should be gone. If you're reading this, because you're wondering why people
make this choice, then there are a few common reasons</p>

<ul class="text-faded">
  <li>You no longer support Reddit as a company, and don't want your content to contribute to their profits</li>
  <li>The content you made no longer represents who you are as a person.</li>
  <li>You've shared personal details you no longer feel comfortable being shared.</li>

</ul>

<p class="text-faded">On Reddit, you <em>can</em> delete your content. But
easy, it is not. You have to go to every single piece of content and
individually choose to delete it. If you've been on the site for years, this
can take hours. Basically it is so inconvinient, that people don't do it. So
even though technically, you own your content, in reality you do not.</p>
